This is a demo to try out my skills in Git
It is really a helpful tool for version control and contribution to code.
You can also track changes.
I made a change here.

Huh, we can also do branches on github.
This is how to do push
        (Make changes in a file in a local repository,
        commit the changes,
        then finnally git push origin)
